# We want to run this job on all changes, so that we do not have to risk breakage slipping
# through due to the set of files included in the version consistency check getting out of sync
# with the set of files checked by the test dispatch logic.
#
# Thus, this job explicitly does not depend on the "Classify Changes" job, like all the other
# jobs in Build and Test do. The lint job also just runs on a subset of changes. So, this ends
# up being a completely independent job.
