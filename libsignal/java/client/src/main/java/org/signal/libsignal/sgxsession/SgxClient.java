/**
 * SgxClient provides bindings to interact with a Signal SGX service.
 *
 * <p>Interaction with the service is done over a websocket, which is handled by the client. Once
 * the websocket has been initiated, the client establishes a connection in the following manner:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>connect to the service websocket, read service attestation
 *   <li>instantiate SgxClient with the attestation message
 *   <li>send SgxClient.initialRequest()
 *   <li>receive a response and pass to SgxClient.completeHandshake()
 * </ul>
 *
 * After a connection has been established, a client may send or receive messages. To send a
 * message, they formulate the plaintext, then pass it to SgxClient.establishedSend() to get the
 * ciphertext message to pass along. When a message is received (as ciphertext), it is passed to
 * SgxClient.establishedRecv(), which decrypts and verifies it, passing the plaintext back to the
 * client for processing.
